Sure! Here's a brief explanation of a queue in English:

**Queue Overview:**

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle. In a queue, elements are added at the rear (enqueue operation) and removed from the front (dequeue operation). This means the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.

**Key Operations:**

1. **Enqueue:** Adds an element to the rear of the queue.
2. **Dequeue:** Removes the element from the front of the queue.
3. **Front:** Retrieves the element at the front without removing it.
4. **Empty:** Checks if the queue is empty.
5. **Full:** Checks if the queue is full, though in many implementations with dynamic memory allocation, this is less common.

**Applications:**

Queues are widely used in computer science for various applications where data is processed in the order it was received, such as:

- **Job scheduling:** Managing tasks in the order they should be executed.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traversing nodes level by level in a graph.
- **Buffer management:** Handling data packets or messages in networking.
- **Print queue:** Managing print jobs in the order they are sent to a printer.

**Implementation:**

Queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists in programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python, etc. The choice of implementation depends on factors like efficiency, ease of insertion/deletion, and memory management requirements.

In essence, queues are fundamental for scenarios where data needs to be processed in a sequential manner, ensuring fairness and order in how tasks or requests are handled.
